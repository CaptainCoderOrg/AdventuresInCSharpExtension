# Adventures in C# Companion Extension

This is the official extension for Captain Coder's Adventures in C#. This extension allows you to load and run
examples from the website directly into VS Code simply by clicking a button.

## Features

This extension provides support for loading examples from Captain Coder's Adventures in C# quickly into
VS Code so you can modify and run them. After clicking a link in the book, a Program.cs file will be
loaded and executed in a terminal. To run the example again, you can run the `Adventures in C#: Run Shared Program`
from the command pallette.

### Sharing Simple Program.cs Files

you can click the share button in the editor menu:

The generated URL provides a link that will open the `Program.cs` file in VS Code. When such a file is active, it can
be run by using the `Adventures in C#: Run Shared Program` command or by clicking the run button in the editor menu:
